# Video Store BackEnd

In this repository I am trying to emulate and old fashion VideoClub using different technologies.

## Tech

| Tech |  |
| ---- | ---- |
| node.js | evented I/O for the backend |
| Express | fast node.js network app framework |
| Mongoose | fast node.js network app framework |
| nodemon | fast node.js network app framework |
| jsonwebtoken | fast node.js network app framework |
| MongoDB | MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era.|
| bcryptjs | Optimized bcrypt in JavaScript with zero dependencies|

## Installation

Video_Store requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14+ to run and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/es)

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
npm i
```
To run the server include the command in a terminal:
```sh
npm run dev
```

To run MongoDB through Docker include the command in a terminal:
```sh
docker run -p 27017:27017 mongo 
```


In order to view the documentation for the API End points in Postman click on the following link and you will be redirected to [POSTMAN](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/14551432/TWDakFHR)

Once you have read the documentation, click on the below button in order to use Postman and try the app.

### Mock_Data

In the files, you will find two MOCK_DATA.json that you will be able to use in order to introduce data in Postman, so you dont need to think :)

#### Thanks

I would like to thanks all my colleagues for the support given, specially to the late night coders!
